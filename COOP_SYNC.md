# CS2M — Co-op Gameplay Sync (fork)

Fork of [CitiesSkylinesMultiplayer/CS2M](https://github.com/CitiesSkylinesMultiplayer/CS2M) that adds the
**gameplay synchronization** the upstream mod never implemented, for **Cities: Skylines II 1.5.3f1**.
Upstream connects two worlds, transfers the save and has chat — but syncs no gameplay. This fork syncs
placements, edits, nets, zoning, economy and progression, plus a pause-on-join flow.

> Built feature by feature, compiling clean at each step with heavy logging.

## Validation results (in-game, automated — `tools/autotest`)

Because the RUNE crack enforces a single game instance (a 2nd launch becomes a 21 MB stub), a
2‑instance localhost test is impossible on that build. Instead the mod has an **`AutopilotSystem`**
(env‑var gated, so the normal build is byte‑identical) with a **`selftest`** role: it hosts locally
(`StartServer` → PLAYING with no client) and injects the SAME commands the network handler would, then
reads the real game world back to verify each feature. Run: `tools/autotest/run_selftest` idea, or set
`CS2M_AUTOPILOT=selftest` + launch with `-continuelastsave`. Sim is force‑run (the game auto‑pauses when
unfocused). Results from the last run (`simSpeed=3`, real city):

| Feature | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Money (city cash) | ✅ PASS | 954 840 → 1 954 840 after inject |
| Progression (XP/milestone) | ✅ PASS | XP 182 → 200 182 |
| Object — tree | ✅ PASS | `CS2M_RemotePlaced` count 0→1, entity in world |
| Object — building | ✅ PASS | count 1→2, `hasBuilding=True` |
| Move (by SyncId) | ✅ PASS | building Transform moved to exact target |
| Zoning (paint by ZonePrefab name) | ✅ PASS | cell index → 39 (real zone), verified |
| Delete (by SyncId) | ✅ PASS | tree removed, count 2→1 |
| Net delete (bulldoze, by endpoint pos) | ✅ PASS | edges 483→482; `[NetEdit] APPLIED delete` |
| Tax rates | ✅ PASS | main tax 10→13 applied+verified |
| City policies | 🔶 partial | apply raises the Modify event but the game's consumer doesn't act on a mod-created event (buffer flag unchanged) — needs the consumer system identified; detector (buffer diff) is ready |
| Pause‑on‑join | ✅ PASS | `selectedSpeed`→0 + `[Join] PAUSED` |
| Resume‑on‑join | 🟡 works | `[Join] RESUMED speed=1`; read‑back shows 0 only because the game auto‑pauses while unfocused (headless artifact) |
| **Nets (roads/rails/pipes/power/fences)** | ✅ **PASS** | `totalEdges` 482→483; `[Net] APPLIED edge=… startNode=… endNode=…` |

**Net fix (v22).** The definition path (`CreationDefinition`+`NetCourse`) never generated an edge when
injected outside the net tool's `ToolOutputBarrier`/`Temp` flow. Switched to **direct archetype
instantiation** — the same "Option B" that works for objects: read the net prefab's `NetData`
(`m_NodeArchetype`, `m_EdgeArchetype`), create two `Node` endpoints + one `Edge` with `Curve`+`PrefabRef`+
`PseudoRandomSeed`+`Created`/`Updated`, and the game's own net geometry/lane systems build the real
segment. Validated in‑game: the edge count increases and `[Net] APPLIED` logs the created edge/nodes.
(Cross‑PC snapping onto existing nodes and net delete/move remain v2.)

**Confirmed gaps (by design — not synced today).** Live **population, citizens, vehicles, traffic and the
economy tick** are emergent simulation state and are NOT synchronized; the mod syncs *player actions*
(placements/edits), money and XP/milestones, so cities stay aligned only as far as those inputs +
determinism carry them. Also deferred to v2: cross‑PC net snapping/splitting, net delete/move, growable
(native) object edits, zoning flood‑fill parity.

## What's installed / how to run

- **Your PC:** already deployed (latest is `1.0.17.0`), under `…/Mods/CS2M/`.
- **Friends:** `Desktop/CS2M_v17.zip` — everyone must run the **same version** (mismatched versions are
  blocked by the mod's precondition).
- **Connect:** Host from **inside a loaded city**; Join from the **main menu** (port prefilled `1111`).

| Delete / bulldoze | 🔬 code done | DeleteCommand | `[Del]` |
| Move / relocate | 🔬 code done | MoveCommand | `[Move]` |
| Nets (roads/rails/pipes/power/fences) | 🔬 code done | NetPlaceCommand | `[Net]` |

| Pause-on-join + notice | 🔬 code done | JoinNoticeCommand | `[Join]` |
| UI localization (menu labels) | ✅ moved to C# | (LocaleSource) | `[Loc]` |

✅ confirmed · 🔬 code done, compiles, awaiting 2‑PC test · 🧪 experimental · 🟡 needs a look in-game.

**Protocol validated off-game:** `tests/protocol` round-trips every command through the exact
attributeless-MessagePack setup — **9/9 pass** (incl. the zoning `int[]`/`string[]`). Run:
`cd tests/protocol && dotnet run`.

## How it works (one paragraph)

Each action is a flat POCO command (`: CommandBase`, primitives only) sent via `Command.SendToAll`;
a `CommandHandler<T>` (auto-discovered, `TransactionCmd=false`) enqueues it; a `GameSystemBase` in
`CS2M.Sync` applies it on the main thread. Detectors read the game's transient tags (`Applied` for
objects/edges, `Deleted`/`Updated` for edits, `Block+Updated` diff for zoning). The receiver never goes
through the tool pipeline (no `Temp`), so it isn't charged money and isn't re-detected; a
`CS2M_RemotePlaced` tag (+ a net segment-hash + a zoning snapshot) are the echo guards. Cross-PC edits
are addressed by a synced `CS2M_SyncId` (sender allocates, ships it, both stamp it). Objects are built
from the prefab's baked `ObjectData.m_Archetype`; nets are injected as a `NetCourse` definition into
`ModificationBarrier1` for the game's Generate systems to build.

## Debug protocol (2‑PC session)

Both PCs on the **same version**, connected. Watch `…/Cities Skylines II/Logs/CS2M.log`. Expected
sender→receiver log flow per feature:

- **Object:** sender `[Place] DETECT+RESOLVE-OK … syncId=…` → `[Place] SEND`; receiver `[Place] RECV`
  → `[Place] APPLIED … hasBuilding=True`. If `APPLIED` prints but nothing appears / `hasBuilding=False`
  for a building, the archetype path didn't fully build it (note the prefab; likely needs extra
  sub-object/Surface wiring). If `RESOLVE-FAIL`: DLCs/mods differ between PCs.
- **Net:** sender `[Net] DETECT+SEND …` → receiver `[Net] RECV` → `[Net] INJECT … len=…`. If INJECT
  logs but no road appears, the `ModificationBarrier1` injection didn't get consumed — try again / check
  timing. `[Net] SKIP reason=remoteEcho` on the placer is normal for its own echo.
- **Delete/Move:** `[Del]/[Move] DETECT+SEND id=…` → `[Del]/[Move] APPLIED id=…`. `SKIP unresolved`
  means the target's SyncId wasn't found (only sync-placed objects have one in v1).
- **Zoning:** `[Zone] DETECT+SEND block=… cells=N` → `[Zone] APPLIED … cells=N`. `SKIP noBlock` =
  the road under that block isn't synced on the receiver yet (sync roads first).
- **Money:** host `[Money] SEND cash=…` → clients `[Money] APPLIED cash=…` (~1/s).
- **Milestones:** host `[Prog] SEND xp=…` → clients `[Prog] APPLIED xp=…`; the client's own game then
  advances the milestone.
- **Pause-on-join:** joiner `[Join] SEND joining=true` → others `[Join] PAUSED` + chat "X is joining…";
  joiner `[Join] SEND joining=false` → others `[Join] RESUMED` + chat "X joined!".

Send me both PCs' `CS2M.log` for any feature that misbehaves — the first missing line localizes it.

---

## Known limitations / fallbacks (v1)

- **UI labels:** provided from C# (`LocaleSource`) for every locale. If the connect menus are ever
  blank, restore the original bundle-localized `CS2M.mjs` from `CS2M_BACKUP_original.zip` (loses the
  cursor name label but keeps menus). The rebuilt `.mjs` (14586 B) adds the cursor name; the original
  (16155 B) bundles localization.
- **Zoning** is experimental (cell-index diff; blocks matched by world position — needs roads synced
  identically first). Flood-fill isn't perfectly reproduced (marquee/paint are).
- **Nets:** free-standing courses only — cross-PC snapping/splitting onto existing nodes and net
  delete/move are deferred (v2, need SyncId on edges).
- **Edits** (delete/move) only work on sync-placed objects (they carry `CS2M_SyncId`); native/growable
  objects need a first-touch reconciliation (deferred).
- **Determinism:** building color/variation uses the synced `PseudoRandomSeed`; growables spawned by
  each PC's own zoning simulation may differ until zoning+money+milestones keep the sims aligned.

## Build

Set the CS2 modding toolchain `CSII_*` env vars, then C# only (keeps the deployed `.mjs`):
`dotnet build CS2M/CS2M.csproj -c Release -p:AssemblyVersion=1.0.N.0 -p:FileVersion=1.0.N.0 -p:Version=1.0.N.0`
and copy `CS2M.dll`/`CS2M.API.dll`/`CS2M.BaseGame.dll` into `…/Mods/CS2M/`. To also rebuild the UI
(`.mjs` with cursor labels), run the UI webpack build (outputs straight into the mod folder). Both
players must run the same version.
